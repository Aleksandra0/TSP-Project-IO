# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Algorithms Implementation

This project implements several heuristic algorithms to solve the **Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. The implemented algorithms include:

- **Nearest Neighbor (NN)**
- **Iterative Hill Climbing with Multistart (IHC)**
- **Simulated Annealing (SA)**
- **Tabu Search (TS)**
- **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**
